excerpt: Designed and developed a network listener module to enhance network security through real-time monitoring. The module captures and filters network packets for detailed analysis.
introduction: This project involved the design and development of a network listener module aimed at enhancing network security through real-time monitoring. The device, based on an AVR microcontroller and an ENC28J60 Ethernet controller, captures and filters IP, ICMP, and ARP packets. The filtered packets are logged in the AVR's internal memory and can also be accessed by a PC via an RS232 port for detailed analysis.
key_features:
  - 'Packet Filtering: Filters packets based on predefined terms for targeted monitoring.'
  - 'Packet Capture: Monitors and captures network-level packets, including IP, ICMP, and ARP.'
  - "Data Logging: Stores filtered packet samples in the AVR's internal memory for later review."
  - 'Real-time Monitoring: Provides continuous monitoring capabilities via a PC console.'
