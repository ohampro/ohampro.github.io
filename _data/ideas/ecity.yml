  info: In the interest of brevity and clarity, certain details have been omitted.
my_role: In this dynamic landscape, my role as an individual innovator took shape, driven by a passion for harnessing technology to address tough challenges. As the sole participant in the ideation process, I embarked on a personal journey to conceptualize solutions through ideation, design, and eventual recognition in a prestigious contest, showcasing the power of individual creativity in shaping the urban landscape.
problem: 
  header: A Monumental Job
  statement: "While cities confront a multitude of challenges, my focus centered on three foundational elements crucial for the sustainability and growth of civilization:"
  points:
    - 'Energy Efficiency: Prioritizing the reduction of energy consumption.'
    - 'Water Management: Adopting comprehensive water management system.'
    - 'Infrastructure Development: Enhancing connectivity, accessibility, and quality of life for residents.'
  direction: "These foundational elements are pivotal for creating a city that not only meets the current needs of its inhabitants but also paves the way for future growth and innovation. The challenge lies in improving these areas."
approach: 
  header: Steps Towards Action
  body: "Despite narrowing down the possibilities for a perfect holistic design to the above-mentioned key sections, the project still loomed monumental. With an action-bias guiding my instincts, I naturally gravitated towards a heuristic approach to make progress rather than endlessly contemplating or getting stuck in analysis paralysis."
discovery: 
  header: Firsthand Empirical Observations
  body: "As a trusted technical services provider with dozens of clients, the documented findings and firsthand empirical observations provided a rich repository of insights, serving as the basis for a field study. Drawing from this wealth of data, several key insights shaped the direction of the project."
  supportings: 
    'Water Management':
      'Water Wastage in Schools':
        body: In the vast majority of cases, schools used to provide drinking water through a type of collective drinking trough equipped with a row of taps. Students, especially younger ones, would often neglect to close the taps, resulting in significant water wastage. With tens of taps in each school and thousands of schools nationwide, this led to a considerable amount of water being wasted every school day.
        'Previously proposed solutions':
          'Student Patrols':
            body: The initial solution was to assign each student the task of monitoring taps and closing them at every break time. (Considering an average of 150 students per school and a maximum of 5 breaks each day). This approach aimed to mitigate water wastage, but we encountered issues such as damp patrols and students deliberately neglecting to close taps, possibly due to shifting responsibility to the patrols.
          'Pedal Operated Taps':
            body: This concept required significant revamping of the drinking troughs' structure. The pedal also served as a plaything for some students, and also mid-quality pedals became damaged after a while.
          'Push Taps':
            body: This Solution proved to be more effective than the previous ones. However, health concerns persisted due to the necessity of pushing the taps.
        conclusion: Influencing policies and measures was beyond the limitation of my young 18-year-old self, as was changing the standards in appliance manufacturing. Therefore, I focused on the observed pain points and inferred that we required taps that operate similarly to push taps, without the need for physical contact and with easy installation. By discussing with other school principals, I ensured that the inference closely matched the expectations.
      'Waiting for Hot Water': 
        topic: When waiting for hot water, it's common to let water run down the drain until it reaches the desired temperature. This process can result in significant water and energy wastage over time due to the distance between the water heater and the tap, as well as poorly insulated plumbing systems.
        body1: There were several practical investigations documented in my notebooks to substantiate this as a genuine area for improvement. In my efforts to confirm that other users elsewhere were also facing the same issue, I found it helpful to engage in discussions with other water heater installation experts and plumbers. It became apparent that attempting to decrease the distance between the water heater and the point of use in response to user requests was a common practice.
        body2: However, we were all operating under a faulty assumption! After a bit of lateral thinking, I noticed that regulations had begun to mandate the installation of gas water heaters far from interior areas, possibly due to concerns about oxygen depletion.
        conclusion: I proposed adding a third pipe to collect and recirculate cold water, eliminating wastage and ensuring safe hot water preparation. To facilitate progress, I employed an iterative problem-solving approach and let deeper issues to surface during the development phase.          
    'Energy Efficiency': 
      'Energy Wastage in Buildings':
        body: During the colder months, substantial amounts of heat were being lost whenever indoor air was exchanged with fresh outdoor air, leading to increased energy consumption to maintain comfortable temperatures. Additionally, hot water used in bathrooms and washing sinks was often wasted as it drained away, carrying valuable heat with it. Another similar issue was poorly insulated areas, which exacerbated this problem by allowing even more heat to escape.
      'Fuel Inefficiency in Public Transportation':
        body: Insights into fuel inefficiency in public transportation revealed by some critical factors stemming from the behavior of both drivers and passengers. Drivers often interrupted smooth driving by reducing bus speed near each stop in anticipation of passengers alighting. Concurrently, passengers' unpredictable requests for unscheduled stops resulted in multiple stops clustered around a single location. These observations underscored the urgent need for a solution to streamline driver behavior and passenger requests.          
    'Infrastructure Development': 
vision:
  header: Blueprints for Tomorrow
  body: My vision extended beyond mere infrastructure development; it aims to propel our cities into a future where technology drives progress and prosperity.

    'Internal Network':
      body: the internal network was designed to facilitate efficient communication between devices through a shared bus system. Each device communicated by sending and receiving messages over this bus, listening for relevant data, detecting it, and executing the necessary actions. The bus operation was managed by shift registers, essential for controlling the data flow. Data transmission involved converting parallel data to serial format using a parallel-to-serial converter and then sending it over the bus. At the receiving end, a serial-to-parallel converter transformed the serial data back into parallel format for processing. This method ensured seamless and orderly communication between devices, leveraging a straightforward yet powerful approach to network design.

    'Stop Request Button in Buses': 
      body: The Stop Request Button can improve fuel efficiency in public transportation systems by minimizing unnecessary idling, providing data for route optimization, and promoting smoother driving patterns. The system was meticulously designed with key factors such as passenger experience, seamless integration into vehicles, and an intuitive interface with audible and visual alerts for both driver and passenger. It includes a prominently placed button for easy passenger access, self-diagnostic capabilities, and mechanisms to prevent accidental activations.

    'Heat Exchange System': 
      body: This system recovers heat from outgoing stale air and transfers it to incoming fresh air, significantly reducing the energy required to maintain comfortable indoor temperatures. Similarly, hot water used in bathrooms and washing sinks often goes to waste as it drains away. To address these issues, I proposed two similar designs using copper thermal exchangers.
