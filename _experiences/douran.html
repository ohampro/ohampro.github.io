excerpt: "At Douran Group, during my involvement with the Business Intelligence subsystem, 
    I developed four innovative tools tailored for ERP development teams,
    resulting in a remarkable 50% to 90% increase in development speed. These tools include a Report Generator, 
    Release Management System, WYSIWYG Cheque Designer, and a Hierarchical Approval Workflow.</br>
    My proficiency in utilizing technologies like Oracle Database, Java, Swing, JSP, Hibernate, GWT, Jasper Report, JDBC, 
    JFC, JBPM, Apache Tomcat, and Subversion played a pivotal role in the success of these tools."
