excerpt: "Throughout this period, I deepened my understanding of distributed systems and 
    real-time stream processing technologies such as Kafka. I also gained valuable insights into ESBs, 
    sharing my hands-on experiences with IoT, Oracle Database, JEE, Web Services, Spring Framework, 
    and Android Development—utilizing technologies like GreenDao, Retrofit, and Socket Programming. 
    Additionally, I honed my skills in employing tools such as Velocity, Jboss, SonarQube, Jira, Gradle, 
    Maven, and Git."
