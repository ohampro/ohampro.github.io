## Detailed Description

### Setting Up the Smart Environment

- ##### Provision of IoT Kits
The company provides IoT kits to various manufacturers, which are then embedded in their products.

- ##### Client Setup
Clients purchase the products and install the Mifo app. By turning on the devices and scanning the QR code, clients can easily connect to the device.

- ##### Connecting Devices
Clients can connect any device to another by simply scanning it, hitting the connect button, and scanning the next device. The gateway itself is considered an IoT device by the Mifo app, allowing users to easily connect other devices to it.

- ##### Gateway Connection
Clients can connect their newly purchased products to their home or business gateway if they have one.

- ##### Control and Monitoring
The Mifo app provides control over the product and displays its status based on the manufacturer's specifications.


### Workflow Definition
The IoT kit and Mifo app offer the ability for a device to be somewhat programmable:

- **User Configuration**: Users can set timers or control flows, such as IF statements, on a connected device to execute.
- **Script Propagation**: The Mifo app propagates the required scripts to the devices, enabling them to function independently of the mobile app.


### Interfaces for Any Object

- **Smart Homes**: Control and monitor home appliances.
- **Smart Museums**: Access detailed information about museum items.
- **Smart Shopping Malls**: View the latest information about products, such as price or inventory status. Add items to a virtual cart for delivery at the exit point. Utilize vertical shelves to optimize space, and much more.
- **Kids Location Tracer**: Track the location of children for parents.
- **Language Learning Labs**: Enhance language learning through interactive tools.
- **Two-Way Radio Channel**: Enable communication through a dedicated channel.
- and more.


### City-Wide Integration
Users can use their Mifo app throughout the city, including in public infrastructure, learning institutions, healthcare facilities, and more.
- **Smart Transportation System**: Provide information about stops, buses, and schedules.
- **Smart Energy**: Optimize the synergy between electric and gas heaters within buildings using thermal sensors.
- **Clean City**: Use pollution sensors (dust or CO2) to provide data for managing traffic and industrial activities.
- **Smart Health and Medical Services**: Implement a range of services, from accident sensor kits and emergency alarms (covering streets) to monitoring patients' vital signs and facilitating medical workflows.

### Business and Manufacturer Benefits
Businesses and manufacturers can track their device or product health and status upon user grant, leading to better services and higher quality products.

### Big Data Analytics
Big data analytics involves external services that users can connect their devices to, obtaining valuable insights and results. By analyzing large datasets, these services can identify patterns and trends that help in optimizing city operations, improving services, and making data-driven decisions.

## Challenges and Solutions
### Challenge
We encountered numerous challenges, such as publishing sensor data while ensuring privacy, maintaining consistent performance under varying usage conditions, and programming our kit to support different modelsâ€”from mini versions with 2 outputs to more complex facilities with multiple PWM outputs. However, the most difficult technical challenge was implementing RSA encryption in our IoT kit due to its resource and speed limitations.

#### Solution
To overcome this, I opted for AES encryption due to its lower computational and memory requirements, and a custom protocol, which reduced the number of messages between peers as well as the message size in bytes.

#### Impact
- AES allowed the IoT kit to operate more efficiently, making better use of its limited resources.
- The data transmitted between the IoT kits and the Mifo app remains secure and protected from potential threats.
