        <h5>The Challenge</h5>
        <h2>A Monumental Job</h2>
        <p>
                While cities confront a multitude of challenges, my focus centered on three foundational elements crucial 
                for the sustainability and growth of civilization:
                <ol>
                        <li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> Prioritizing the reduction of energy consumption.</li>

                </ol>
                <ul class="d-none">
                        <li>1. <strong>Energy Control:</strong>
                                Implementing remote monitoring and control mechanisms to manage energy consumption effectively, 
                                optimizing usage and reducing wastage.
                        </li>
                        <li>2. <strong>Reducing Water Wastage:</strong>
                                Addressing the issue of rampant water wastage through the development of efficient 
                                water management systems.
                        </li>
                        <li>3. <strong>Streamlining Transportation:</strong>
                                Tackling traffic congestion and transportation inefficiencies through the design of 
                                smart mobility solutions and infrastructure improvements.
                        </li>

        <h2>Steps Towards Action</h2>
        <p>
                Despite narrowing down the possibilities for a perfect design to the above-mentioned sections,
                the project still loomed monumental. I naturally gravitated towards a heuristic approach to make
                progress rather than endlessly contemplating.

        <h2>Blueprints for Tomorrow</h2>
        <p>
                My vision extended beyond mere infrastructure development; it aims to propel our cities into 
                a future where technology drives progress and prosperity. 
                I worked towards creating a design that leveraging data to understand consumption patterns, 
                encouraging manufacturers to develop cutting-edge solutions, and actively involving residents in the 
                technological evolution of their communities.

        <h5>Design Overview</h5>
        <h2></h2>
        <p>
        The idea is to interconnect various points in the city to monitor, analyize, and control energy and water consumption.
        To achieve this, I designed a modular unit that can connect with similar units to form the network needed to reach the goal.

                This supports certain services selected for the initial design and can connect to other 
                modules using either the telephone line or its own wireless radio channel.
        </p>
        <p>List of services includes:</p>
        <ul>
                <li>Manual Access</li>
                <li>Tel Line Access</li>

        <h5>Approach Details</h5>
        <h2></h2>
        <p>
        Living in a mid-sized city with limited access to electronic chipsets and other resources didn't hinder 
        my passion to achieve my goal. I started with the knowledge I had and steadily made progress 
        toward the future. I immersed myself in all the electronics books I could find and brainstormed the 
        necessary services I had listed. Through designing complex circuits, I developed the higher-level modules 
        needed to bring my vision to life.

        <h2>Independent Innovation</h2>
        <p>
                For each weakness, opportunity, or threat related to the identified challenges, 
                I went through cycles of identifying the real issue, brainstorming innovative solutions,

        <h3>Internal Network</h3>
        <p>
                the internal network was designed to facilitate efficient communication between devices through 
                a shared bus system. Each device communicated by sending and receiving messages over this bus, 
                listening for relevant data, detecting it, and executing the necessary actions. 
                The bus operation was managed by shift registers, essential for controlling the data flow. 
                Data transmission involved converting parallel data to serial format using a parallel-to-serial 
                converter and then sending it over the bus. At the receiving end, a serial-to-parallel converter 
                transformed the serial data back into parallel format for processing. 
                This method ensured seamless and orderly communication between devices, 
                leveraging a straightforward yet powerful approach to network design.

                It measures energy consumption in real-time, providing valuable data for efficient power management. 
                In the event of a power outage or fluctuation, the system automatically switches to backup batteries,
