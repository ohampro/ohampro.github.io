        <h5>The Challenge</h5>
        <h2>A Monumental Job</h2>
        <p>
                While cities confront a multitude of challenges, my focus centered on three foundational elements crucial 
                for the sustainability and growth of civilization:
                <ol>
                        <li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> Prioritizing the reduction of energy consumption.</li>
                        <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Implementing integrated water management system.</li>
                        <li><strong>Infrastructure Development:</strong> Enhancing connectivity, accessibility, and quality of life for residents.</li>
                </ol>
                <ul class="d-none">
                        <li>1. <strong>Energy Control:</strong>
                                Implementing remote monitoring and control mechanisms to manage energy consumption effectively, 
                                optimizing usage and reducing wastage.
                        </li>
                        <li>2. <strong>Reducing Water Wastage:</strong>
                                Addressing the issue of rampant water wastage through the development of efficient 
                                water management systems.
                        </li>
                        <li>3. <strong>Streamlining Transportation:</strong>
                                Tackling traffic congestion and transportation inefficiencies through the design of 
                                smart mobility solutions and infrastructure improvements.
                        </li>
                        <li>4. <strong>Promoting Tech-Integrated Lifestyles:</strong>
                                Fostering acceptance and integration of technology into modern life, encouraging individuals to 
                                embrace technological interventions for sustainable living practices.

        <h2>Steps Towards Action</h2>
        <p>
                Despite narrowing down the possibilities for a perfect design to the above-mentioned sections,
                the project still loomed monumental. I naturally gravitated towards a heuristic approach to make
                progress rather than endlessly contemplating.

        <h5>The Vision</h5>
        <h2>Blueprints for Tomorrow</h2>
        <p>
                My vision extended beyond mere infrastructure development; it aims to propel our cities into 
                a future where technology drives progress and prosperity. 
                I worked towards creating a design that leveraging data to understand consumption patterns, 
                encouraging manufacturers to develop cutting-edge solutions, and actively involving residents in the 
                technological evolution of their communities.
        {% if site.user == 'mhp' %}
        <p class="d-none">
                In envisioning an electronics city, my overarching goal is to pioneer a transformative shift in 
                urban living, one that seamlessly integrates technology into the fabric of our community. 
                My vision extends beyond mere infrastructure development; it embodies a collective aspiration to 
                propel our cities into a future where technology serves as an enabler of progress and prosperity for all. 
                By harnessing the power of electronics, I aim to redefine traditional approaches to urbanization, 
                fostering an environment where the barriers to efficiency and accessibility are dismantled. 
                This vision is not confined to the realm of imagination; it is a tangible commitment to building a vibrant, 
                interconnected city that empowers its residents and cultivates innovation at every turn. 
                Through collaboration, creativity, and a steadfast dedication to excellence,

        <h5>Design Overview</h5>
        <h2></h2>
        <p>
        The idea is to interconnect various points in the city to monitor, analyize, and control energy and water consumption.
        To achieve this, I designed a modular unit that can connect with similar units to form the network needed to reach the goal.
        </p>

        <h3>Base Module</h3>
        <p>
                This supports certain services selected for the initial design and can connect to other 
                modules using either the telephone line or its own wireless radio channel.
        </p>
        <p>List of services includes:</p>
        <ul>
                <li>Manual Access</li>
                <li>Tel Line Access</li>
                <li>Wireless Access</li>
                <li>Extendable Internal Network</li>
                <li>Remote Control System</li>
                <li>Automatic Control</li>
                <li>Smart Meters</li>

        <h2></h2>
        <p>
        Living in a mid-sized city with limited access to electronic chipsets and other resources didn't hinder 
        my passion to achieve my goal. I started with the knowledge I had and steadily made progress 
        toward the future. I immersed myself in all the electronics books I could find and brainstormed the 
        necessary services I had listed. Through designing complex circuits, I developed the higher-level modules 
        needed to bring my vision to life.
