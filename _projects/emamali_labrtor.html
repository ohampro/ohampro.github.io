excerpt: "An Electronics Language Lab long before digital classrooms became standard, revolutionizing language 
    learning by providing students with advanced tools and interactive experiences such as a 
    Teacher Control Console for communication and audio distribution, audio recordings, interactive quizzes, 
    group activities, and individual workstations with headphones, microphones, and keypads for 
    private listening and speaking practice."
